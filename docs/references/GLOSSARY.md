# Glossary
A list of terms and definitions related to the vehicle, the rules or the software.

## Scope
This will exclusively be a long list of terms and their definitions.

## Definitions
|Term|Definition|
|-|-|
|**Accumulator**|Batteries and/or capacitors that store the electrical energy to be used by the tractive system. This term includes both electrochemical batteries and ultracapacitor devices.|
|**Accumulator Container**|A housing that encloses the accumulator devices, isolating them both physically and electrically from the rest of the vehicle.|
|**Accumulator Segment**|A subgroup of accumulator devices that must adhere to the voltage and energy limits listed in Table 8.|
|**AMS**|Accumulator Monitoring System. EV9.6|
|**Barrier**|A material, usually rigid, that resists a flow of charge. Most often used to provide a structural barrier and/or increase the creepage distance between two conductors. See Figure 36.|
|**BRB**|Big Red Button. EV7.5 and EV7.6|
|**Creepage Distance**|The shortest distance measured along the surface of the insulating material between two conductors. See Figure 36.|
|**Enclosure**|An insulated housing containing electrical circuitry.|
|**GLV**|Grounded Low Voltage system - Every conductive part that is not part of the tractive system. (This includes the GLV electrical system, frame, conductive housings, carbon-fiber components etc.)|
|**GLVMS**|Grounded Low Voltage Master Switch. EV7.3|
|**IMD**|Insulation Monitoring Device. EV9.4|
|**Insulation**|A material that physically resists a flow of charge. May be rigid or flexible.|
|**Isolation**|Electrical, or “Galvanic” isolation between two or more electrical conductors such that if a voltage potential exists between them, no current will flow.|
|**Region**|A design/construction methodology wherein enclosures are divided by insulating barriers and/or spacing into TS and GLV sections, simplifying the electrical isolation of the two systems.|
|**Separation**|A physical distance (“spacing”) maintained between conductors.|
|**SMD**|Segment Maintenance Disconnect. EV2.7|
|**ESOK**|Electrical Systems OK. EV9.3|
|**Tractive System (TS)**|The drive motors, the accumulators and every part that is electrically connected to either of those components.|
|**Tractive System Enclosure**|A housing that contains TS components other than accumulator devices.|
|**TSSI**|Tractive System Status Indicator. EV2.9.1|
|**TS/GLV**|The relationship between two electrical conductors; one being part of the TS system and the other GLV.|
|**TS/TS**|The relationship between two TS conductors. This designation implies that they are at different potentials and/or polarities.|
|**TSMP**|Tractive System Measuring Points. EV10.3|
|**TSMS**|Tractive System Master Switch. EV7.4|
