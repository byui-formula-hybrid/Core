# ESP32 Formula Hybrid Core Library - Documentation Standards

This directory contains technical documentation for the ESP32 Formula Hybrid Core Library. This document establishes standards and expectations for all documentation in this project.

## üìã **Documentation Standards**

### **Writing Style**
- **Technical but accessible** - Assume reader has basic embedded/automotive knowledge
- **Concise and actionable** - Every document should have clear takeaways
- **Safety-focused** - Always emphasize safety considerations for race car applications
- **Version-aware** - Include version/date information where relevant

### **Required Structure**
All major documentation files must include:

1. **Purpose statement** - What this document covers and why it exists
2. **Scope and limitations** - What's included/excluded
3. **Safety considerations** - Race car specific safety requirements
4. **Technical specifications** - Concrete implementation details
5. **Examples and code samples** - Practical usage demonstrations
6. **References and links** - External standards, datasheets, regulations

## üìÅ **Documentation Organization**

### **Core Documentation Files**
- `README.md` - This standards document  
- `Design.md` - **Vehicle system design** - Overall car architecture and major subsystems
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - **ESP32 library architecture** - Internal code structure and module organization
